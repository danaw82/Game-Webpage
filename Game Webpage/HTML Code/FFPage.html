        <blockquote>
            The Final Fantasy X-2 story takes place in Spira two years after Final Fantasy X, told by former summoner
            turned sphere hunter, Yuna.
            Three groups—New Yevon, the Youth League, and the Machine Faction—have risen to replace the fallen Yevon
            temple and strive to guide Spira into a new age.
            As everyone in Spira adjusts to living in a world without Sin, political conflicts between the three groups
            gradually escalate to threatening war.
            The dangers of progress and a force from the ancient past threaten to make history repeat itself and destroy
            the newfound peace.
            Yuna and her friends, old and new, must rise to the occasion to save Spira once again while she holds on to
            the hope of reuniting with her lost love.
