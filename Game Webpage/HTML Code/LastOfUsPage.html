    <blockquote>
        Set in a post-apocalyptic 2023, The Last of Us presents a world that's been ravaged by a pandemic caused by a
        fungus called “cordyceps” (terrifyingly, a real fungus), which turns its hosts into violent zombie-like
        creatures whose only goal is to spread the infection.

        </p>
